== Bugs
    - Footer doesn't stick to bottom on 404 page.
    - +1 on cap pages isn't working...

== Enhancements after release
    === General improvements
    - Implement all recommendations given by Chrome's PageSpeed extension.
    - Canonicalize on www URL subdomain
    - Maybe have each cap image's background switch to a highlighted green version on hover
    - Use feedburner?
    - Add superfeedr hub link to RSS feeds
    - Pagination. Infinite scroll, with standard paging for fallback.
    - Aggregate/compress CSS and JS
    - Use Sass for CSS
    - Implement Schema.org microdata: http://schema.org/docs/gs.html
    - Implement Open Graph protocol: http://ogp.me/
    - Meta title and description? https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/+1button/#plus-snippet
    - Watch: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35624
    - Google Sitemap: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=183668
    - Try these for nav links, etc:
        text-shadow: white 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em;
        text-shadow: 2pxpx 2px 2px rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);
    - Admin interface
    - We define records in data.clj but don't always use them, often just creating a map
    - Implement encrypted PayPal buttons to avoid users tampering with prices, etc.

      Current version of the site uses non-encrypted buttons anyway

    === Admin backend
    - Add a history tracking entity. When a cap attribute is changed, store a
      diff into a History domain; something like
      {:type cap :changed-field "price" :old-value "25" :date-changed "2011-02-01"}.
      The same could apply to other items as well.
    - If/when an item is renamed, it cannot be renamed to a name that a different
      item has owned in the past so 301 redirects converge on the unique items
