= TODO

== Currently working on
    - Need to forward old URLs for blog items

== Need before release
    - /caps and /merch category routes need to resolve to a filtered view
    - /store.rss contains the old site's RSS and a new feed as well
      Do I need a historic version of old items? How far back does RSS file history go?
      Maybe just do 10.
      Use feedburner!
      Have blog.atom(?), store.atom, and all.atom

    - Valentine's string in Valentine cap contains funky character
      Jetty not returning UTF-8 response correctly?

== Enhancements after release
    - AJAX pagination
    - Footer doesn't stick to bottom on 404 page.
    - +1 on cap pages isn't working...
    - Try these for nav links, etc:
        text-shadow: white 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em;
        text-shadow: 2pxpx 2px 2px rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);
    - Admin interface
    - Implement encrypted PayPal buttons to avoid users tampering with prices, etc.

      Current version of the site uses non-encrypted buttons anyway
