= TODO

== Need before release
    - Set up the legacy RSS feed to include recent entries and point to new blog
    - /caps and /merch category routes need to resolve to a filtered view
    - Add superfeedr hub link to RSS feeds
    - Implement blog page(s). We've already forwared old URLs to new URLs, implement
      all blog views (/blog, /blog/url-title). Shouldn't be tough, just do it.
    - Use feedburner?
    - Google Analytics

== Enhancements after release
    - Some images in S3 are corrupted/don't work (see: /blog/lord-of-griffith-ii image)
    - Pagination. Infinite scroll, with standard paging for fallback.
    - Jetty not returning UTF-8 response correctly?
      ? Valentine's string in Valentine cap contains funky character
    - Footer doesn't stick to bottom on 404 page.
    - +1 on cap pages isn't working...
    - Aggregate/compress CSS and JS
    - Implement Schema.org microdata: http://schema.org/docs/gs.html
    - Implement Open Graph protocol: http://ogp.me/
    - Meta title and description? https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/+1button/#plus-snippet
    - Watch: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35624
    - Google Sitemap: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=183668
    - Try these for nav links, etc:
        text-shadow: white 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em;
        text-shadow: 2pxpx 2px 2px rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);
    - Admin interface
    - We define records in data.clj but don't always use them, often just creating a map
    - Implement encrypted PayPal buttons to avoid users tampering with prices, etc.

      Current version of the site uses non-encrypted buttons anyway
