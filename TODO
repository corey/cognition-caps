== Currently working on

      ! Need to develop route for /caps vs /merch and change up +1 buttons accordingly
        Update: routes work, need to investigate +1 buttons.

      * Need to forward old URLs for merch items
      * Need to forward old URLs for blog items
      * Test that +1 urls are set correctly for caps as well as merch
      * Test that /caps/foo and /merch/foo either match up or are 404'd appropriately
    - AJAX pagination


== Need before release
    - +1 on cap pages isn't working...

    - Valentine's string in Valentine cap contains funky character
      Jetty not returning UTF-8 response correctly?

    - Implement Schema.org microdata: http://schema.org/docs/gs.html
    - Implement Open Graph protocol: http://ogp.me/
    - Meta title and description? https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/+1button/#plus-snippet
    - Watch: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35624
      Google Sitemap: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=183668

    - Nice 404 page

    - Try these for nav links, etc:
        text-shadow: white 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em;
        text-shadow: 2pxpx 2px 2px rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);

== Enhancements after release
    - Implement encrypted PayPal buttons to avoid users tampering with prices, etc.
      https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_html_encryptedwebpayments#id08A3I0P017Q
      Current version of the site uses non-encrypted buttons anyway
