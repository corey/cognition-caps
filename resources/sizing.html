<div id="sizing">
    <p>Our caps include elastic in the rear and are one-size-fits-most. We also
       make a large size for those of us who are cranially gifted, but we
       realize that many people don't fit into the standard sizing so if you
       require a specially sized cap, feel free to
       <a href="mailto:orders@wearcognition.com?subject=Sizing Inquiry">contact us</a>
       and we'll make sure you get a cap you'll be happy with.</p>

    <p>This isn't an exact science, but here's a general sizing chart to get
       you in the ballpark. To measure your head, grab a tape measure (the
       flexible kind, not metal) or a string which you'll measure later and
       wrap it around your noggin, lining it up where the sweatband of a cap
       would sit.</p>

       <table>
           <tr>
               <th>Cognition Size</td>
               <th>Inches</td>
               <th>Hat Size</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
               <td>One Size Fits Most</td>
               <td>22 to 23-1/2</td>
               <td>7 to 7-1/2</td>
